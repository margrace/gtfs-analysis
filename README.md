# gtfs-analysis
This repository contains data and code relating to GTFS analysis for multiple cities.

The main goal of this project is to create a framework that quickly analyzes and classifies a public transit network published under GTFS standards. 

The classification of the routes is based on multiple criterea:
- The average inter-stop speed of the transit vehicles.
- The average distance/time between stops.
- The operational hours and schedule range.
- The frequency of passage.

Different GTFS datasets are provided, including:
- Valencia (Valencia, Spain)
    - EMT Valencia (urban bus network).
    - Metrovalencia (metro network).
    - Metrobús (intercity bus).
- Montréal (Québec, Canada)
